\textbf{\textsf{1. INCIDENT DESCRIPTION}}\\[1pt]
Opposing counsel in \textit{Martinez v.\ Consolidated Industries} alerted the firm that a summary judgment motion contained citations that, while identifying real cases, mischaracterized holdings. The motion was prepared using the firm's agentic legal research system, which iteratively investigates legal questions through 2--6 research cycles, adapting search strategies based on relevance patterns.\\[4pt]

\textbf{\textsf{2. IMPACT ASSESSMENT}}\\[1pt]
\textbf{2.1} \textit{Professional Responsibility.} Potential violation of ABA Model Rule 3.3 (Candor Toward the Tribunal) due to submission of inaccurate case characterizations.\\[2pt]
\textbf{2.2} \textit{Client Impact.} Motion credibility compromised; client notified; fee reduction offered.\\[2pt]
\textbf{2.3} \textit{Scope.} Review of 47 prior research sessions identified 6 additional sessions (13\%) with cross-cycle adaptation errors.\\[4pt]

\textbf{\textsf{3. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE}}\\[1pt]
\textbf{3.1} System access suspended firm-wide pending investigation (Mar 15).\\[2pt]
\textbf{3.2} Corrected motion filed with court; candor-to-tribunal explanation submitted per Rule 3.3 (Mar 16).\\[2pt]
\textbf{3.3} Client notified of incident and offered fee reduction for affected matter (Mar 17).\\[2pt]
\textbf{3.4} All pending matters using system flagged for manual citation verification (Mar 17).\\[4pt]

\textbf{\textsf{4. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS}}\\[1pt]
\textbf{4.1} \textit{Cycle-Level Audit.} Investigation of iteration logs revealed: Cycles 1--3 correctly identified 8 relevant cases. Cycle 4 detected contradictory authority and attempted to ``harmonize'' holdings through paraphrasing---introducing mischaracterization. Cycles 5--6 propagated the erroneous synthesis without detecting the error.\\[2pt]
\textbf{4.2} \textit{Adaptation Failure.} The system's contradiction-resolution logic created hallucination risk by paraphrasing holdings rather than preserving verbatim quotations.\\[2pt]
\textbf{4.3} \textit{Termination Failure.} System terminated based on confidence threshold (>0.85) despite holding mischaracterization; confidence metric measured legal relevance but did not capture citation accuracy.\\[4pt]

\textbf{\textsf{5. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS}}\\[1pt]
\textbf{5.1} \textit{Adaptation Constraints.} System reconfigured to prohibit paraphrasing of holdings; require verbatim quotations with Bluebook pin cites for all case references.\\[2pt]
\textbf{5.2} \textit{Cross-Cycle Consistency.} Implemented automated flagging when later cycles contradict earlier findings; contradictions now escalate to attorney rather than automated resolution.\\[2pt]
\textbf{5.3} \textit{Termination Revision.} Confidence threshold revised: system terminates only when legal relevance confidence >0.85 AND citation accuracy score >0.95 (verified via database cross-check).\\[2pt]
\textbf{5.4} \textit{HITL Verification.} Attorneys must review cycle-by-cycle logs, not just final output; research workpapers must document validation of each cited case.\\[4pt]

\textbf{\textsf{6. PREVENTIVE ACTIONS}}\\[1pt]
\textbf{6.1} Quarterly iteration audits established: sample 15\% of research sessions; review cross-cycle adaptation patterns for citation accuracy.\\[2pt]
\textbf{6.2} Training updated: all attorneys complete 2-hour module on agentic system risks and cycle-level review requirements.\\[2pt]
\textbf{6.3} Vendor notified of defect; contractual SLA for accuracy monitoring invoked.\\[4pt]

\textbf{\textsf{7. LESSONS LEARNED}}\\[1pt]
\textbf{7.1} Iteration and adaptation compound errors across cycles; single-point output review is insufficient for agentic systems.\\[2pt]
\textbf{7.2} Confidence thresholds must incorporate domain-specific accuracy metrics (citation fidelity), not just relevance scores.\\[2pt]
\textbf{7.3} Professional duty (Rule 1.1 competence) requires attorneys to understand iterative system logic, not merely review outputs.\\[4pt]

\caption{Incident report for an agentic legal research system failure. The report follows ISO 27001 incident management standards (classification, root cause analysis, corrective and preventive actions) while documenting an agentic-specific failure mode: cross-cycle error propagation where the system's adaptation logic introduced hallucinations that compounded across subsequent iterations.}
