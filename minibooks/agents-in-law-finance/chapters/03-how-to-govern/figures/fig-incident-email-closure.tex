Incident FL-2024-003 is now closed. The system has been remediated and redeployed.\\[5pt]
\textbf{Root Cause: Process-Based Discrimination.} The discrimination wasn't in the scoring model---Cycle 1 was facially neutral and passed traditional fairness tests. The problem was \textit{how the system investigated applicants across subsequent cycles}:\\[2pt]
\begin{tabular}{@{\hspace{0.8em}\textbullet~}p{8.0cm}@{}}
Hispanic applicants triggered more verification cycles (5.2 avg vs.\ 3.8)\\[1pt]
System flagged shorter U.S.\ employment tenure for extra scrutiny---a proxy for national origin\\[1pt]
Extended verification led to higher abandonment: 28\% Hispanic vs.\ 12\% white\\
\end{tabular}\\[2pt]
The system discriminated in its \textit{process}, not its \textit{decisions}. Qualified applicants dropped out because we investigated them more aggressively.\\[5pt]
\textbf{Remediation.} Before redeploying: (1) prohibited employment tenure from influencing investigation depth; (2) added cycle-count parity monitoring (flags >20\% deviation); (3) implemented abandonment tracking by protected class; (4) revalidated for outcome \textit{and} process fairness.\\[5pt]
\textbf{Notifications.} Jennifer filed our CFPB self-report on July 12th. Her team sent letters to all 847 affected applicants offering expedited re-review, waived fees, and priority processing. 312 have requested re-review.\\[5pt]
\textbf{Going Forward.} Marcus is updating our AI Governance framework to treat ``iteration bias'' as a distinct risk category. We're revising validation protocols to require fairness testing across the full investigation process, not just final decisions.\\[5pt]
Full post-incident review at next month's board meeting.\\[6pt]
