\section{Conversational Models and State}
\label{sec:llmB-convo}

% Outline (comments): roles; conversation memory; context budgeting; safety prompts
\begin{definitionbox}[title={Roles and State}]
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Roles:} system, user, assistant; when to set constraints at the system level.
  \item \textbf{State:} short vs. long-term context; summarization vs. full replay.
  \item \textbf{Budgeting:} keep critical instructions near the end; repeat key constraints.
\end{itemize}
\end{definitionbox}

\subsection{Memory Strategies}
Short-term summaries conserve context; retrieval memories rehydrate facts on demand. Choose based on length, accuracy needs, and audit requirements.

\subsection{Context Management and Instruction Placement}
Repeat key constraints near the end of the prompt; use reminders to mitigate forgetting. Track cumulative token budgets.

\subsection{Safety and Guardrails (Preview)}
Define allowed/blocked topics and refusal criteria at the system level; log policy versions. Part~III covers governance controls.
