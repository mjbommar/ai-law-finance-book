I'm escalating a critical issue that requires your immediate awareness. Our compliance team's monthly fairness review identified a significant disparity in the agentic mortgage underwriting system this morning: Hispanic applicants have a 65\% approval rate compared to 82\% for white applicants. This violates the 80\% rule commonly used in disparate impact analysis (65/82 = 79.3\%) and constitutes a potential ECOA fair lending violation.\\[6pt]
\textbf{Actions taken in the last two hours:}\\[3pt]
\begin{tabular}{@{\hspace{1em}\textbullet~}p{11.5cm}@{}}
Halted the agentic underwriting system immediately per emergency stop protocol\\[1pt]
Reverted all mortgage applications to manual underwriting\\[1pt]
Preserved 12 months of cycle-level system logs in read-only archive\\[1pt]
Convened incident response team: Jennifer Walsh (GC) is leading legal strategy, Marcus Thompson (AI Governance), and Rita Gonzalez (Mortgage Systems Lead)\\
\end{tabular}\\[6pt]
I just got off the phone with Jennifer. As you know, ECOA violations create strict liability---intent doesn't matter. She's already reviewing our regulatory notification obligations and will have a timeline for CFPB self-reporting by tomorrow. We face potential enforcement action, class action exposure, and reputational risk.\\[6pt]
I'm requesting an emergency board briefing within 72 hours to approve the investigation scope and remediation budget. I'll send a detailed findings report once the investigation is complete.\\[8pt]
