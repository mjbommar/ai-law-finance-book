\section{Synthesis and Executive Roadmap}
\label{sec:agents3-synthesis}

We tie obligations to controls, controls to evidence, and evidence to protocol‑level traceability. The roadmap explicitly builds on Part I: phase by autonomy and actuation risk; align oversight modes to goal dynamics; ensure persistence‑aware provenance.

\begin{keybox}[title={Phased Roadmap}]
\begin{itemize}
  \item Phase 0: Policy updates, inventory, DPIA/TRA templates.
  \item Phase 1: Low‑risk research with strict attribution and audit.
  \item Phase 2: Workflow automation with human‑in‑the‑loop and SLAs.
  \item Phase 3: Limited actuation with conformance gates and rollback.
\end{itemize}
\end{keybox}
