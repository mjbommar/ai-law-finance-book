\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Conclusion}

Effective governance is a build‑time choice. By instrumenting attribution, privilege boundaries, and auditability into protocols and workflows, executives can approve deployments with confidence and continuously improve against clear KPIs. The controls and tests here intentionally rest on Part I’s simple, shared foundations—what an agent \emph{is}, what makes a system \emph{agentic}, and how \emph{autonomy}, \emph{entity frames}, \emph{goal dynamics}, and \emph{persistence} shape risk.
