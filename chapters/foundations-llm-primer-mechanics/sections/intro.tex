\section{Introduction and Scope}
\label{sec:llmA-intro}

We provide a conceptual primer for modern language models used in legal and financial work. The chapter starts with a brief history and then explains how prompts become token sequences and how models generate continuations (``completions'').

\paragraph{Relationship to Later Chapters.} This chapter feeds later foundations on conversations, structured outputs, tools, multimodal inputs, and prompt engineering. Agents Part~I assumes this vocabulary.
