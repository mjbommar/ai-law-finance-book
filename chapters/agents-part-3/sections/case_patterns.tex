\section{Case‑Based Patterns and Rollout Playbooks}
\label{sec:agents3-cases}

Use Part I’s \emph{Autonomy} and \emph{Entity Frame} to pick oversight modes, and use \emph{Persistence} to set audit/retention. Sequence by risk and actuation scope.

\subsection{Small/Mid‑Size Firm}
Managed service with SOC 2 vendor, strong protocol metadata, and clear privilege controls; start with low‑risk research use cases.

\subsection{Enterprise Firm}
Hybrid model with on‑prem enclaves for privileged work; multi‑vendor strategy with protocol conformance testing; formal change advisory board.

\subsection{In‑House Legal/Finance}
Tighter integration with ERP/GL and records; strict segregation of duties and audit trails tied to financial close and disclosure controls.

\subsection{Courts and Public Sector}
Accessibility, records retention, and open justice considerations; conservative oversight modes and robust provenance.
