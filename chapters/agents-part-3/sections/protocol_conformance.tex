\section{Protocol Conformance: Interoperability and Traceability}
\label{sec:agents3-conformance}

Layer 5 validates that protocols advertise capabilities and carry governance metadata required for audit and policy enforcement. In Part I terms, this instruments the \emph{Perception} and \emph{Action} channels so every observation and actuation is typed, attributed, and traceable across \emph{persistent} sessions.

\subsection{Capability Descriptors}
Tools and agents must publish machine‑readable actions with schemas, pre/postconditions, data classifications, and audit requirements. Describe autonomy/actuation risk so orchestrators can select oversight modes.

\subsection{Governance Metadata on Calls}
Each call should include purpose, user identity, data class, privilege flag, jurisdiction, retention directive, and correlation IDs for full traceability.

\subsection{Conformance Tests}
Automated tests should confirm descriptor completeness, metadata presence, and end‑to‑end replayability from logs (provenance), with negative tests for missing or malformed metadata.
