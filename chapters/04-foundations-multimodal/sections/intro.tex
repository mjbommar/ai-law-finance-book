\section{Introduction and Scope}
\label{sec:llmD2-intro}

We address practical multimodal inputs common to legal and finance: preserving structure in PDFs, extracting tables and charts, interpreting images/screenshots, and summarizing audio. We also highlight privacy and redaction patterns.

\paragraph{Note on Embeddings Across Modalities.} Text is not the only modality that benefits from vector representations. OCR for scanned filings, captioned figures, tables, and audio transcripts often become text first and then use embeddings for retrieval; see \Cref{sec:llmA-embeddings,sec:llmC-rag} for foundations.
