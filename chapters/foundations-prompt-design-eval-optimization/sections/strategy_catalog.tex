\section{Strategy Catalog: When and Why}
\label{sec:llmE-strategy}

% Outline (comments):
% - Direct prompting vs. structured scratchpads (CoT) vs. short rationales
% - Self-consistency (multi-sample) and voting/aggregation
% - ReAct: reasoning + acting with tools; trace separation
% - Tree/Graph-of-Thought for branching exploration
% - Few-shot retrieval selection and budgeting
% - Decision table: pick simplest strategy that meets evidence/risk needs

\begin{keybox}[title={Decision Table (High Level)}]
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Low-risk, fast:} direct prompting with minimal constraints.
  \item \textbf{Schema-bound:} direct prompting + validators; low temperature.
  \item \textbf{Hard reasoning:} CoT or short scratchpads; consider self-consistency.
  \item \textbf{Tool workflows:} ReAct-style traces; separate logs vs. user output.
  \item \textbf{Exploration/branching:} Tree/Graph-of-Thought within budget.
\end{itemize}
\end{keybox}
