\section{Threat Modeling and Red-Teaming}
\label{sec:llmE-threats}

% Outline (comments): prompt injection/exfiltration; tool misuse; data poisoning; jailbreaks; mitigations
\begin{cautionbox}[title={Common Threats}]
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prompt injection and data exfiltration via untrusted content.
  \item Tool misuse or over-broad scopes; missing idempotency.
  \item Data poisoning in retrieval indexes or training sets.
  \item Jailbreaks that bypass policy constraints.
\end{itemize}
\end{cautionbox}

\begin{keybox}[title={Test and Mitigate}]
\begin{itemize}
  \item Red-team corpora with known attacks; track detection and failure types.
  \item Input/output validation, allow/deny lists, and sanitization.
  \item Strict schemas, function calling, least privilege on tools.
  \item Monitoring for anomaly spikes; kill-switches and rollback plans.
\end{itemize}
\end{keybox}
