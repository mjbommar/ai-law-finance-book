\section{Synthesis and Handoff to Governance}
\label{sec:agents2-synthesis}

We synthesize architectural and protocol guidance into a minimal viable agent blueprint and identify the governance controls that Part III will require (transparency, audit, privilege, jurisdictional policy, and deployment gates).

\begin{keybox}[title={From Build to Govern}]
\begin{itemize}
  \item Instrument audit and provenance at design time; do not bolt on later.
  \item Treat protocols as control planes: they carry governance metadata.
  \item Validate Layers 1--3 before advancing to governance evaluation.
\end{itemize}
\end{keybox}
