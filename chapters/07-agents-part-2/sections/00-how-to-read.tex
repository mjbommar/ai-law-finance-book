Part I established \textit{what} an agent is. Part II shows \textit{how} to build one. This chapter is technical but conceptual; you will understand agent architecture, protocols, and evaluation without writing code. Think of it like understanding how a legal department or asset manager organizes work: you will learn the roles and workflows (tools, memory, planning, and communication protocols) without needing to perform them yourself. You will gain the vocabulary to assess vendor claims, participate in procurement decisions, and understand how production agent systems are constructed.
